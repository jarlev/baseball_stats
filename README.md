<h3><u>Hello, welcome to my baseball_stats app!</u></h3>
<br>

<h4>My initial goal was to create an application that people could find useful. Combining my passions for baseball and softball with web developement, I came up with this idea.</h4>

<ul>There are several uses behind this application:
	<li>A baseball or softball league can create its league within the app and create/tailor seasons to their liking.
	Once a season and schedule have been created, the league commissioner can begin recording each game, play-by-play, inning by inning. Team managers can also record their team's games, but the two teams' scorecards must match up.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Eventually, I'd like to make the app iPad-friendly so that managers can record games live in their dugouts. They also, of course, have the option of recording entire games after they have already been completed.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>This app is very customizable with various parameters for creating leagues, seasons, schedules, teams and players.</li>
	<li>Once the game logging process has begun, the application will begin to track team statistics as well as individual player metrics.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The app will instantly calculate advanced baseball statistics instantly on the team-show and player-show pages.</li>
			<li>In addition to creating advanced metrics (useful for analyzing recent trends, i.e. the underlying causes behind hot streaks or slumps), the app will also track each team's record in every season, and will determine the playoff teams and seeding based on the commissioner's preferences</li>
		</ul>
	<li>I'm hoping that, once the app is up and fully running, real leagues will considering using it to automate their league recording process. It could be useful for travel, high school, adult intramural leagues, etc.</li>
</ul>

<em><strong>Please note:</strong></em> the app is not yet complete, so it does not fully work yet. I will continue to push my commits as often as I can.

If you have any questions or suggestions for the app, please feel free to reach out.

Thanks!
